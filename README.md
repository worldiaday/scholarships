# Scholarships 

World IA Day Scholarships benefit underrepresented people with financial need who are studying information architecture, information management, and design disciplines anywhere in the world. Scholarships are awarded on a rolling basis dependent on the conference.

Our primary goal is to increase diversity in the information professions and to build communities. Scholarship recipients are not only selected for their talent and need, but, most importantly, for their demonstrated commitment to giving back to the Information Architecture community through volunteer service and work.
